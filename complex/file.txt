Bonasera... Bonasera... What have I ever
done to make you treat me so
disrespectfully? Had you come to me in
friendship, then this scum that ruined
your daughter would be suffering this very
day. And that by chance if an honest man
such as yourself should make enemies, then
they would become my enemies. And then
they would fear you.
