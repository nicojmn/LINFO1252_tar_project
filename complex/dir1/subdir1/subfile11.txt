I understand. You found paradise in
America, had a good trade, made a good
living. The police protected you; and
there were courts of law. And you didn't
need a friend of me. But uh, now you come
to me and you say "Don Corleone give me
justice." But you don't ask with respect.
You don't offer friendship. You don't even
think to call me Godfather. Instead, you
come into my house on the day my daughter
is to be married, and you uh ask me to do
murder, for money.
