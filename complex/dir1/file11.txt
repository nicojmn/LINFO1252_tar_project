I believe in America. America has made my
fortune. And I raised my daughter in the
American fashion. I gave her freedom, but
I taught her never to dishonor her family.
She found a boyfriend; not an Italian. She
went to the movies with him; she stayed
out late. I didn't protest. Two months
ago, he took her for a drive, with another
boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey.
And then they tried to take advantage of
her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So
they beat her, like an animal. When I went
to the hospital, her nose was a'broken.
Her jaw was a'shutted, held together by
wire. She couldn't even weep because of
the pain. But I wept. Why did I weep? She
was the light of my life ... beautiful
girl. Now she will never be beautiful
again.
