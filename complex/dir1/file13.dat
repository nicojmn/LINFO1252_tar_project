We've known each other many years, but
this is the first time you came to me for
counsel, for help. I can't remember the
last time that you invited me to your
house for a cup of coffee, even though my
wife is godmother to your only child. But
let's be frank here: you never wanted my
friendship. And uh, you were afraid to be
in my debt.
