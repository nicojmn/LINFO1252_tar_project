I-I went to the police, like a good
American. These two boys were brought to
trial. The judge sentenced them to three
years in prison ... suspended sentence.
Suspended sentence! They went free that
very day! I stood in the courtroom like a
fool. And those two bastard, they smiled
at me. Then I said to my wife, "for
justice, we must go to Don Corleone."
